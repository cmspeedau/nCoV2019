Honduras tests

======================
2020-07-10
There is a decrease in the number of 'total_cases' reported for June 9. However, the new daily cases
reported on June 9 is positive so the 'total_cases' decrease is erroneous. 

'total_cases' for June 9 is calculated as the sum of 'total_cases' from June 8 and the daily cases for June 9.
